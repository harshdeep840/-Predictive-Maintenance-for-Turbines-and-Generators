#  Predictive Maintenance for Turbines and Generators
Predictive Maintenance Dashboard is a real-time anomaly detection system designed to monitor the health of turbine and generator equipment using sensor data. This project leverages an autoencoder-based deep learning model to identify deviations in temperature, vibration, and pressure readings that may indicate potential failures. The Streamlit web application visualizes Mean Squared Error (MSE) trends over time and flags anomalies dynamically, helping maintenance teams take preemptive action. Additionally, users can input specific timestamps to instantly check the maintenance status at that moment. This tool showcases the power of AI-driven preventive strategies in industrial IoT environments.
